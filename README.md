# Educational Technology Plan for CJHS STEM

This Education Technology Plan will overview the context and plan for the middle school robotics class I will be teaching.

## Context

### Course

#### STEM 
This course introduces students to engineering principles through robotics.  Students will learn how engineers solve problems collaboratively.  Students will design, build, program and test robotic designs using the VEX IQ robotics system. Students will work in teams to develop increasingly-difficult robotics challenges through the year. STEM is available to 6th-8th students as an elective. Students develop basic skills needed before attempting design challenges.

### Situation

Students will be entering the class with a range of interest levels.  Some students selected the elective, while others were placed based on lack of input of schedule conflicts. Likewise, Students will have a wide range of ability levels as some will have prior experience with robotics and programming, while this will be the first experience in mechatronics and CS for others.

#### Assets
* **30** [VEX IQ Education Kits](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-8899.html#)
* **One-to-one** chromebook ratio
* District-wide access to Google Apps For Education (GAFE)
* **5** additional classroom issued chromebooks for temporary use

#### Constraints
* 50 min class periods, longer sessions would be ideal
* [CJHS SARC report](https://sarconline.org/public/summary/04614246057137/2023-2024)
* Title 1 school
* Large class sizes, up to 36 students

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.
* Instructor will use AERIES software to report grades and take attendance
* Google Classroom as a learning management system
* Google Slides for students to document their daily progress through a digital engineering journal
* ChromeOS for students to access Chrome web browser and save files to their chromebooks
* [VEXcode IQ](https://codeiq.vex.com/) as the web-based IDE for students to program their robots using their chromebooks.  There is also a free extension available for VSCode.  

### Hardware Specifications
Teacher Laptop Spec go here:
Dell Precision

Student chromebook spec go here:


The VEX IQ Robot brain connects to a computer via an USB-C to USB-A 2.0 cable.  Proprietary smart cables connect up to 12 motors and/or sensors.  Each brain has a 3 inch LCD screen.  There are 8 save slots to hold unique programs, as well as a microSD port for storing more data. Student chromebooks

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
