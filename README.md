# Educational Technology Plan

This Education Technology Plan will overview the context and plan for the middle school robotics class I will be teaching.

## Context

### Course

#### STEM 
This course introduces students to engineering principles through robotics.  Students will learn how engineers solve problems collaboratively.  Students will design, build, program and test robotic designs using the VEX IQ robotics system. Students will work in teams to develop increasingly-difficult robotics challenges through the year. STEM is available to 6th-8th students as an elective.

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?
#### Assets
* 30 [VEX IQ Education Kits](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-8899.html#)
* One-to-one chromebook ratio
* 5 additional classroom issued chromebooks for temporary use

#### Constraints
* 50 min class periods
* [CJHS SARC report](https://sarconline.org/public/summary/04614246057137/2023-2024)
* Title 1 school

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.
* Google Classroom as a learning management system
* Google Slides for students to document their daily progress through a digital engineering journal
* ChromeOS for students to access Chrome web browser and save files to their chromebooks
* [VEXcode IQ](https://codeiq.vex.com/) as the IDE for students to program their robots

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
